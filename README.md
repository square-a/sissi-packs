# sissi-packs

## Introduction
_Sissi-packs_ is part of [sissi](https://github.com/AlexKott/sissi), a simple static site generator. Because _sissi_ doesn't like to do everything on herself, she employs some modules who can help. _Sissi_ is still young and the modules might change from time to time to adjust to her different life situations.

Of course you can use _sissi-packs_ independently as well if it fits your needs. Just consider that the main goal for the module is, to make _sissi_ happy. Everything else is just an extra.

## Installation
When you're asking for _sissi_, _sissi-packs_ is already included. For every other use case just do the usual:

`yarn add sissi-packs`

or

`npm i sissi-packs`


## Contributing
This is just one of several things that _sissi_ needs for her well being. It is important to keep all settings focussed on her so that she'll always be the center.

Feel free to open an issue or [get in touch](https://alexkott.com), if you're interested in helping _sissi_ through her childhood or see some parenting mistake that you'd like to fix.


## Credits
_Sissi-packs_ was heavily inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
